)

// PartialMe holds the first name of the currently logged-in user.

		"ovh-eu",
		YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY,
		YOUR_APPLICATION_SECRET,
		YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY,
	)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error: %q\n", err)
		return
	}

	err = client.Get("/me", &me)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error: %q\n", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Printf("Welcome %s!\n", me.Firstname)
}
```

## Installation

The Golang wrapper has been tested with Golang 1.18+. It may worker with older versions although it has not been tested.

To use it, just include it to your ``import`` and run ``go get``:

```go
import (
	...
	"github.com/ovh/go-ovh/ovh"
)
```

## Configuration

The straightforward way to use OVHcloud's API keys is to embed them directly in the
application code. While this is very convenient, it lacks of elegance and
flexibility.

Alternatively it is suggested to use configuration files or environment
variables so that the same code may run seamlessly in multiple environments.
Production and development for instance.

`go-ovh` supports two forms of authentication:
- OAuth2, using scopped service accounts, and compatible with OVHcloud IAM
- application key & application secret & consumer key

### OAuth2

First, you need to generate a pair of valid `client_id` and `client_secret`: you
can proceed by [following this documentation](https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm/en-manage-service-account?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0059343)

Once you have retrieved your `client_id` and `client_secret`, you can create and edit
a configuration file that will be used by `go-ovh`.

```ini
[default]
; general configuration: default endpoint
endpoint=ovh-eu

[ovh-eu]
; configuration specific to 'ovh-eu' endpoint
client_id=my_client_id
client_secret=my_client_secret
```

The client will successively attempt to locate this configuration file in

1. Current working directory: ``./ovh.conf``
2. Current user's home directory: ``~/.ovh.conf``
3. System wide configuration: ``/etc/ovh.conf``

Depending on the API you want to use, you may set the ``endpoint`` to:

* ``ovh-eu`` for OVHcloud Europe API
* ``ovh-us`` for OVHcloud US API
* ``ovh-ca`` for OVHcloud Canada API

This lookup mechanism makes it easy to overload credentials for a specific
project or user.

### Access Token

This authentication method is useful when short-lived credentials are necessary.
E.g. oauth2 [plugin](https://github.com/puppetlabs/vault-plugin-secrets-oauthapp)
for HashiCorp Vault can request an access token that would be used by OVHcloud
terraform provider. Although this token, requested via data-source, would end up
stored in the Terraform state file, that would pose less risk since the token
validity would last for only 1 hour.

Other applications are of course also possible.

In order to use the access token with this wrapper either use
`ovh.NewAccessTokenClient` to create the client, or pass the token via
`OVH_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable to `ovh.NewDefaultClient`.

### Application Key/Application Secret

If you have completed successfully the __OAuth2__ part, you can continue to
[the Use the Lib part](https://github.com/ovh/go-ovh?tab=readme-ov-file#use-the-lib).

This section will cover the legacy authentication method using application key and
application secret.
This wrapper will first look for direct instanciation parameters then
``OVH_ENDPOINT``, ``OVH_APPLICATION_KEY``, ``OVH_APPLICATION_SECRET`` and
``OVH_CONSUMER_KEY`` environment variables. If either of these parameter is not
provided, it will look for a configuration file of the form:

```ini
[default]
; general configuration: default endpoint
endpoint=ovh-eu

[ovh-eu]
; configuration specific to 'ovh-eu' endpoint
application_key=my_app_key
application_secret=my_application_secret
consumer_key=my_consumer_key
```

Depending on the API you want to use, you may set the ``endpoint`` to:

* ``ovh-eu`` for OVHcloud Europe API
* ``ovh-us`` for OVHcloud US API
* ``ovh-ca`` for OVHcloud Canada API
* ``soyoustart-eu`` for So you Start Europe API
* ``soyoustart-ca`` for So you Start Canada API
* ``kimsufi-eu`` for Kimsufi Europe API
* ``kimsufi-ca`` for Kimsufi Canada API
* Or any arbitrary URL to use in a test for example

The client will successively attempt to locate this configuration file in

1. Current working directory: ``./ovh.conf``
2. Current user's home directory ``~/.ovh.conf``
3. System wide configuration ``/etc/ovh.conf``

This lookup mechanism makes it easy to overload credentials for a specific
project or user.

#### Register your app

OVHcloud's API, like most modern APIs is designed to authenticate both an application and
a user, without requiring the user to provide a password. Your application will be
identified by its "application secret" and "application key" tokens.

Hence, to use the API, you must first register your application and then ask your
user to authenticate on a specific URL. Once authenticated, you'll have a valid
"consumer key" which will grant your application on specific APIs.

The user may choose the validity period of his authorization. The default period is
24h. He may also revoke an authorization at any time. Hence, your application should
be prepared to receive 403 HTTP errors and prompt the user to re-authenticate.

This process is detailed in the following section. Alternatively, you may only need
to build an application for a single user. In this case you may generate all
credentials at once. See below.

##### Use the API on behalf of a user

Visit [https://eu.api.ovh.com/createApp](https://eu.api.ovh.com/createApp) and create your app
You'll get an application key and an application secret. To use the API you'll need a consumer key.

The consumer key has two types of restriction:

* path: eg. only the ```GET``` method on ```/me```
* time: eg. expire in 1 day

Then, get a consumer key. Here's an example on how to generate one.

First, create a 'ovh.conf' file in the current directory with the application key and
application secret. You can add the consumer key once generated. For alternate
configuration method, please see the [configuration section](#configuration).

```ini
[ovh-eu]
application_key=my_app_key
application_secret=my_application_secret
; consumer_key=my_consumer_key
```

Then, you may use a program like this example to create a consumer key for the application:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/ovh/go-ovh/ovh"
)

func main() {
	// Create a client using credentials from config files or environment variables
	client, err := ovh.NewEndpointClient("ovh-eu")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error: %q\n", err)
		return
	}
	ckReq := client.NewCkRequest()

	// Allow GET method on /me
	ckReq.AddRules(ovh.ReadOnly, "/me")

	// Allow GET method on /xdsl and all its sub routes
	ckReq.AddRecursiveRules(ovh.ReadOnly, "/xdsl")

	// Run the request
	response, err := ckReq.Do()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error: %q\n", err)
		return
	}

	// Print the validation URL and the Consumer key
	fmt.Printf("Generated consumer key: %s\n", response.ConsumerKey)
	fmt.Printf("Please visit %s to validate it\n", response.ValidationURL)
}
```

##### Use the API for a single user

Alternatively, you may generate all creadentials at once, including the consumer key. You will
typically want to do this when writing automation scripts for a single projects.

If this case, you may want to directly go to https://eu.api.ovh.com/createToken/ to generate
the 3 tokens at once. Make sure to save them in one of the 'ovh.conf' configuration file.
Please see the [configuration section](#configuration).

``ovh.conf`` should look like:

```ini
[ovh-eu]
application_key=my_app_key
application_secret=my_application_secret
consumer_key=my_consumer_key
```

## Use the lib

These examples assume valid credentials are available in the [configuration](#configuration).

### GET

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/ovh/go-ovh/ovh"
)

func main() {
	client, err := ovh.NewEndpointClient("ovh-eu")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error: %q\n", err)
		return
	}

	// Get all the xdsl services
	xdslServices := []string{}
	if err := client.Get("/xdsl/", &xdslServices); err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error: %q\n", err)
		return
	}

	// xdslAccess represents a xdsl access returned by the API
	type xdslAccess struct {
		Name   string `json:"accessName"`
		Status string `json:"status"`
		Pairs  int	`json:"pairsNumber"`
		// Insert the other properties here
	}

	// Get the details of each service
	for i, serviceName := range xdslServices {
		access := xdslAccess{}
		url := "/xdsl/" + serviceName

		if err := client.Get(url, &access); err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("Error: %q\n", err)
			return
		}
		fmt.Printf("#%d : %+v\n", i+1, access)
	}
}
```

### PUT

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/ovh/go-ovh/ovh"
)

func main() {
	client, err := ovh.NewEndpointClient("ovh-eu")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error: %q\n", err)
		return
	}

	// Params
	type AccessPutParams struct {
		Description string `json:"description"`
	}

	// Update the description of the service
	params := &AccessPutParams{Description: "My awesome access"}
	if err := client.Put("/xdsl/xdsl-yourservice", params, nil); err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error: %q\n", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("Description updated")
}
```

### Use v1 and v2 API versions

When using OVHcloud APIs (not So you Start or Kimsufi ones), you are given the
opportunity to aim for two API versions. For the European API, for example:

- the v1 is reachable through https://eu.api.ovh.com/v1
- the v2 is reachable through https://eu.api.ovh.com/v2
- the legacy URL is https://eu.api.ovh.com/1.0

Calling `client.Get`, you can target the API version you want:

```go
client, _ := ovh.NewEndpointClient("ovh-eu")

// Call to https://eu.api.ovh.com/v1/xdsl/xdsl-yourservice
client.Get("/v1/xdsl/xdsl-yourservice", nil)

// Call to https://eu.api.ovh.com/v2/xdsl/xdsl-yourservice
client.Get("/v2/xdsl/xdsl-yourservice", nil)

// Legacy call to https://eu.api.ovh.com/1.0/xdsl/xdsl-yourservice
client.Get("/xdsl/xdsl-yourservice", nil)
```

## API Documentation

### Create a client

- Use ``ovh.NewDefaultClient()`` to create a client using endpoint and credentials from config files or environment
- Use ``ovh.NewEndpointClient()`` to create a client for a specific API and use credentials from config files or environment
- Use ``ovh.NewOAuth2Client()`` to have full control over their authentication, using OAuth2 authentication method
- Use ``ovh.NewAccessTokenClient()`` to have full control over their authentication, using token that was previously issued by auth/oauth2/token endpoint
- Use ``ovh.NewClient()`` to have full control over their authentication, using legacy authentication method

### Query

Each HTTP verb has its own Client method. Some API methods supports unauthenticated calls. For
these methods, you may want to use the ``*UnAuth`` variant of the Client which will bypass
request signature.

Each helper accepts a ``method`` and ``resType`` argument. ``method`` is the full URI, including
the query string, and ``resType`` is a reference to an object in which the json response will
be unserialized.

Additionally, ``Post``, ``Put`` and their ``UnAuth`` variant accept a reqBody which is a
reference to a json serializable object or nil.

Alternatively, you may directly use the low level ``CallAPI`` method.

- Use ``client.Get()`` for GET requests
- Use ``client.Post()`` for POST requests
- Use ``client.Put()`` for PUT requests
- Use ``client.Delete()`` for DELETE requests

Or, for unauthenticated requests:

- Use ``client.GetUnAuth()`` for GET requests
- Use ``client.PostUnAuth()`` for POST requests
- Use ``client.PutUnAuth()`` for PUT requests
- Use ``client.DeleteUnAuth()`` for DELETE requests

### Request consumer keys

__[Only valid for legacy authentication method]__

Consumer keys may be restricted to a subset of the API. This allows to delegate the API to manage
only a specific server or domain name for example. This is called "scoping" a consumer key.

Rules are simple. They combine an HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT or DELETE) with a pattern. A pattern
is a plain API method and may contain the '*' wilcard to match "anything". Just like glob on a
Unix machine.

While this is simple and may be managed directly with the API as-is, this can be cumbersome to do
and we recommend using the ``CkRequest`` helper. It basically manages the list of authorizations
for you and the actual request.

*example*: Grant on all /sms and identity
```go
client, err := ovh.NewEndpointClient("ovh-eu")
if err == nil {
    // Do something
}
req := client.NewCkRequest()
req.AddRules(ovh.ReadOnly, "/me")
req.AddRecursiveRulesRules(ovh.ReadWrite, "/sms")
pendingCk, err := req.Do()
```

This example will generate a request for:

- GET /me
- GET /sms
- GET /sms/*
- POST /sms
- POST /sms/*
- PUT /sms
- PUT /sms/*
- DELETE /sms
- DELETE /sms/*

Which would be tedious to do by hand...

*Create a ``CkRequest``*:

```go
req := client.NewCkRequest()
```

*Request access on a specific path and method* (advanced):
```go
// Use this method for fine-grain access control. In most case, you'll
// want to use the methods below.
req.AddRule("VERB", "PATTERN")
```

*Request access on specific path*:
```go
// This will generate all patterns for GET PATH
req.AddRules(ovh.ReadOnly, "/PATH")

// This will generate all patterns for PATH for all HTTP verbs
req.AddRules(ovh.ReadWrite, "/PATH")

// This will generate all patterns for PATH for all HTTP verbs, except DELETE
req.AddRules(ovh.ReadWriteSafe, "/PATH")
```

*Request access on path and all sub-path*:
```go
// This will generate all patterns for GET PATH
req.AddRecursiveRules(ovh.ReadOnly, "/PATH")

// This will generate all patterns for PATH for all HTTP verbs
req.AddRecursiveRules(ovh.ReadWrite, "/PATH")

// This will generate all patterns for PATH for all HTTP verbs, except DELETE
req.AddRecusriveRules(ovh.ReadWriteSafe, "/PATH")
```

*Create key*:

```go
pendingCk, err := req.Do()
```

This will initiate the consumer key validation process and return both a consumer key and
a validation URL. The consumer key is automatically added to the client which was used to
create the request. It may be used as soon as the user has authenticated the request on the
validation URL.


``pendingCk`` contains 3 fields:
- ``ValidationURL`` the URL the user needs to visit to activate the consumer key
- ``ConsumerKey`` the new consumer key. It won't be active until validation
- ``State`` the consumer key state. Always "pendingValidation" at this stage
